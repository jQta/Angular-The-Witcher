    of his heroics throughout the continent even if he has to embellish them a
    little for a few coins more,Tissaia de Vries, Yennefer's secretive mentor
    who believes in tough love, and
    <a href="../characters/6246c5c060e2fb752e34c4bb">Triss Merigold</a>, a
    good-natured druidic mage and trustworthy friend. The Nilfgaardian Empire's
    sudden brutal invasion of the kingdom of Cintra ruled by Cirilla's
    protective grandmother, warrior queen Calanthe, puts their lives in great
    danger.
